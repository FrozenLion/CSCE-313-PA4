Multi threaded server-client file and data transfering based on PA2.

PA5 is included in this repo. This involves the user choosing between fifo, mqueue and shared memory for transfering data between the server and client.

PA6 is also included in this repo. This involves using sockets to make a connection between the client and server as another way of transferring data.
